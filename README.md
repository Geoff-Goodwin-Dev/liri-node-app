# LIRI NodeJs Application

* **Created:** Saturday, April 14th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the tenth week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are building a NodeJS based application.  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
'In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.'
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
* You'll need to have NodeJS installed on your computer since this application has no wep-page front-end
* This application also will require you have API keys for the following:
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api
    * OMDB API: http://www.omdbapi.com
* As the APIs do require API keys, the credential management is being handled with a .env file ('dotenv': https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
```

### Prerequisites

These are things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
see 'Getting Started' section above
```

### Installing

These are a set of step-by-step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running:

```
1.) Install NodeJS
2.) Download Git repository
```
